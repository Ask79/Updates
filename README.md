Update posts/blog on what I'm working on ;)


Working on two projects at the moment! 

1) MiniGpt...helping me master fundamentals of Pytorch and AI programming/math. Will revisit after first build to train on unique dataset and test evaluation

2) Independent Research Interpretability Project...currently reading tons of papers to help bring me up to speed. Starting Decemeber, I will reproduce a paper I'm passionate about. And, in January, I will work on extending said paper with a proposed change to method or training.
